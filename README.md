### What I learned

With this project I learned more about CSS Grid, specially about the `grid-template-areas` and its importance to create responsive layouts. With this property I was able to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes easily, if I hadn't use it I would have to create a lot of media queries to make the layout responsive and add a lot more HTML elements to make it work.

### Useful resources
